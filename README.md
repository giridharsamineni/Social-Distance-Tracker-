# Social-Distance-Tracker-
The Covid-19 had a huge impact on different sectors in many countries and such impact caused problems to many people around the world. This small step of wearing a face mask as well as following social distancing would save lots of lives as the spread of the virus could be mitigated.  In order to make it possible governments are monitoring people daily . This become very hard task because it is impossible to check each and every person whether they are following social distancing.

Computer Vision:**    Computer Vision is the subset of Artificial Intelligence that uses the computerâ€™s power to extract meaningful information from the provided datasets, those datasets can be Images, Videos, etc. This use of computer vision can be extended to many other applications depending upon the use cases.
YOLO:     The Yolo algorithm stands for You Only Look Once, this algorithm is a state of art, which works on a real-time system, build on deep learning for solving various Object Detection as well as Object Tracking problems.

**Mean Average Precision:**
Finally, to evaluate the training of the model based on the dataset provided was done with mAP (Mean Average Precision), it is based on the calculations for Mean Average Precision over all the calculation based on the classes present in the training data & the overall IoU (Intersection Over Union) threshold. The percentage of the threshold for which the AP was calculated as 0.25 % with 101 Recall Points.
